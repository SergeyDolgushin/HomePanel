# Notes:
# - Keep android/src/, android/AndroidManifest.xml and other Android sources under version control.
# - If you store prebuilt .so/.aar/.jar files intentionally under android/libs/, remove/adjust ignore rules so they are not excluded.
#   Example to allow android/libs/*.so keep them: add "!android/libs/*.so" if you later add a rule that would exclude them.
